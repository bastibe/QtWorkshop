Qt Workshop
===========

These are the example projects for a workshop given on Qt/QML in the Jade Hochschule (University of Applied Sciences in Oldenburg, Germany).

The German documentation is available in *doc_de*.

- __CounterPlugin__
  is a QML plugin that contains a C++ class that implements a counter, with a property containing the current value and a slot that increments that value.
- __Drawing__
  is an iPython notebook (both source and PDF) where we implemented a fancy clock using the QML Canvas component.
- __Minimal__
  is a C++ project that implements a minimal qmake project with program icon, translation, custom types and a QML engine. This can be used as a base to build new projects on.
- __MyComponents__
  are two QML components that implement a slider and a button in pure QtQuick.
- __PyQtAudioPlayer__
  is a simple audio player written in PyQt and QML that demonstrates how to integrate the two.
- __TimePlugin__
  is a QML plugin that provides three read-only properties for the current hour, minute, and second.
